# this project

this is a really basic project that is pretty much a todo list tracker, i made this in a dotfile on my local machine so i can just pin it to my bar and have a basic todo thing.

# details
not really well made a just thrown together, not a lot of changes will be made i guess

```
npm i typescript --save-dev
tsc
```

# linting
i made some of this on my friends pc and they had a config that used 4 spaces and single quotes, so yes this is not my usual formatting.                    

# use it here!
[todo-list](https://mipan.site) uses local storageon the browser, which is not the most secure thing in the world. Anyways im hosting this on an express server instance.
