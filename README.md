# this project
This project is a really simple and does not really have a lot of advanced features. This was made just as a test to see how I fair with electron since I have not been writing a lot of code as of late. Anyways here is a simple-to-use, minimalistic and feature-lacking dum dum application that I made in a few hours.

# set up
```
git clone <repo url here>
npm i
build
```
